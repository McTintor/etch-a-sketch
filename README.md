Etch-a-Sketch Project
Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project! This web-based application allows you to draw and sketch on a canvas with customizable settings, including the number of pixels and color options.

Features

Canvas Drawing: Express your creativity by drawing on the canvas with a simple mouse or touchpad interaction.

Adjustable Pixel Count: Customize the canvas resolution by changing the number of pixels (divs) to fit your preferences and artistic needs.

Color Options: Choose between a classic black color or a dynamic rainbow color mode. In rainbow mode, colors are randomly generated using RGB values, providing a vibrant and unique drawing experience.
